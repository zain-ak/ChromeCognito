# ChromeCognito 

A simple AppleScript script to open a new Google Chrome window in incognito mode with a specific user profile. 

I've uploaded two custom icons (in resources) that I designed for fun; you can save the script as a .app file and run it like you would any other application. Now it has a cool icon to boot xD
