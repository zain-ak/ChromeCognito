A simple AppleScript script to open a new Google Chrome window in incognito mode with a specific user profile.

**Note:** You'll have to play around with the ```--profile-directory``` argument to open the window with the desired user profile. There's no option to put the name in the profile.

I've uploaded two custom icons (in resources) that I designed for fun; you can save the script as a .app (which I've also uploaded) file and run it like you would any other application. Now it has a cool icon to boot xD
